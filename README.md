# Giphy API Query
UofT Bootcamp - Week 6 Assignment

# Description
Match your mood to a fun GIF. Add mood selector buttons and save your favourites for later. 

## Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery
* AJAX used to query the GIPHY API
* Local Storage used to save the user's 'favourited' mood buttons

## Resolutions
I wanted to add a feature to this program that would allow users to store their favourite mood selectors for later use. I accomplished this by storing the value of 'favorited' selectors in local storage, and then pulling the data (in JSON format) from there when the user loaded the browser
 
## Instructions
* Click a mood button and watch the screen populate with 10 static Gif's
* Click the GIF to animate it
* Use the submission bar in the upper right hand corner to add your favourite moods
